## 🚀 What’s Inside?  

Here’s the juicy roadmap of topics waiting for you:

### 🌱 Basics & Setup
- Intro to Machine Learning  
- Feature Engineering  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

### 📊 Regression & Metrics
- Simple Linear Regression (SLR)  
- Evaluation Metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²  

### 🔥 Supervised Learning Fun
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Trees  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM) & Naive Bayes  

### 💪 Ensemble & Advanced Techniques
- Bagging & Boosting  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Stacking & Many More  

Every topic comes with **Pythonic code you can run**, explanations that actually make sense, and **hands-on datasets**.
